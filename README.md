# Ethereum-Fraud-Detection
Detecting Fraudulent Blockchain Accounts on Ethereum with Supervised Machine Learning
<h1 id= "top doc"> Description </h1>

1. General info

Since 2021, more than 46,000 people lost over $1 billion to cryptocurrency scams, nearly 60 times more compared to 2018.1 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that the top cryptocurrencies used to pay scammers were Bitcoin (70%), Tether (10%) and Ethereum (9%).1 Especially, with the most recent incident with FTX, a crypto exchange which misused more than $1 billion of clientâ€™s funds, it becomes ever more important to stay vigilant when navigating through the cryptocurrency world.
 To enforce deterrence against fraudulent scams, we used **pycaret** to know the best methods that can be used in this project.  We set an objective to achieve more than 95% F1 score for machine learning models in predicting fraudulent accounts on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Dataset information

This dataset contains rows of known fraud and valid transactions made over Ethereum, a type of cryptocurrency.

Here is a description of the rows of the dataset:

- Index: the index number of a row
- Address: the address of the ethereum account
- FLAG: whether the transaction is fraud or not
- Avg min between sent tnx: Average time between sent transactions for account in minutes
- Avg min between received tnx: Average time between received transactions for account in minutes
- Time Diff between first and_last (Mins): Time difference between the first and last transaction
- Sent_tnx: Total number of sent normal transactions
- Received_tnx: Total number of received normal transactions
- NumberofCreated_Contracts: Total Number of created contract transactions
- UniqueReceivedFrom_Addresses: Total Unique addresses from which account received transaction
- UniqueSentTo_Addresses20: Total Unique addresses from which account sent transactions
- MinValueReceived: Minimum value in Ether ever received
- MaxValueReceived: Maximum value in Ether ever received
- AvgValueReceived5Average value in Ether ever received
- MinValSent: Minimum value of Ether ever sent
- MaxValSent: Maximum value of Ether ever sent
- AvgValSent: Average value of Ether ever sent
- MinValueSentToContract: Minimum value of Ether sent to a contract
- MaxValueSentToContract: Maximum value of Ether sent to a contract
- AvgValueSentToContract: Average value of Ether sent to contracts
- TotalTransactions(IncludingTnxtoCreate_Contract): Total number of transactions
- TotalEtherSent:Total Ether sent for account address
- TotalEtherReceived: Total Ether received for account address
- TotalEtherSent_Contracts: Total Ether sent to Contract addresses
- TotalEtherBalance: Total Ether Balance following enacted transactions
- TotalERC20Tnxs: Total number of ERC20 token transfer transactions
- ERC20TotalEther_Received: Total ERC20 token received transactions in Ether
- ERC20TotalEther_Sent: Total ERC20token sent transactions in Ether
- ERC20TotalEtherSentContract: Total ERC20 token transfer to other contracts in Ether
- ERC20UniqSent_Addr: Number of ERC20 token transactions sent to Unique account addresses
- ERC20UniqRec_Addr: Number of ERC20 token transactions received from Unique addresses
- ERC20UniqRecContractAddr: Number of ERC20token transactions received from Unique contract addresses
- ERC20AvgTimeBetweenSent_Tnx: Average time between ERC20 token sent transactions in minutes
- ERC20AvgTimeBetweenRec_Tnx: Average time between ERC20 token received transactions in minutes
- ERC20AvgTimeBetweenContract_Tnx: Average time ERC20 token between sent token transactions
- ERC20MinVal_Rec: Minimum value in Ether received from ERC20 token transactions for account
- ERC20MaxVal_Rec: Maximum value in Ether received from ERC20 token transactions for account
- ERC20AvgVal_Rec: Average value in Ether received from ERC20 token transactions for account
- ERC20MinVal_Sent: Minimum value in Ether sent from ERC20 token transactions for account
- ERC20MaxVal_Sent: Maximum value in Ether sent from ERC20 token transactions for account
- ERC20AvgVal_Sent: Average value in Ether sent from ERC20 token transactions for account
- ERC20UniqSentTokenName: Number of Unique ERC20 tokens transferred
- RC20UniqRecTokenName: Number of Unique ERC20 tokens received
- ERC20MostSentTokenType: Most sent token for account via ERC20 transaction
- ERC20MostRecTokenType: Most received token for account via ERC20 transactions


2. Used methods

we used ***Grid search*** to find the best parameters of the most famous **LGBMClassifier** algorithm, we also used the following methods and libraries

- Pycaret

- LGBMClassifier



# Highlights



 ```python

lgb_c = lgb.LGBMClassifier(boosting_type='gbdt', class_weight=None, colsample_bytree=1.0,
               importance_type='split', learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=-1,
               min_child_samples=20, min_child_weight=0.001, min_split_gain=0.0,
               n_estimators=100, n_jobs=-1, num_leaves=31, objective=None,
               random_state=85, reg_alpha=0.0, reg_lambda=0.0, silent='warn',
               subsample=1.0, subsample_for_bin=200000, subsample_freq=0)
